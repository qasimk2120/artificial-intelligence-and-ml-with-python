# AI & Robotics Portfolio

This repository contains my **personal learning notes, experiments, and practical projects** across **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Robotics**.

The focus of this repo is **deep understanding, experimentation, and trade-off analysis** rather than production-ready systems.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is **learning-first**.

It intentionally contains:

- multiple approaches to the same problem
- exploratory notebooks
- algorithm comparisons
- detailed explanations and reasoning

The goal is to **understand why things work**, not just to make them work.
