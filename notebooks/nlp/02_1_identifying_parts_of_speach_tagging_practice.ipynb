    "After pre-processing text (for example using n-grams), we can extend our analysis by **tagging** the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common types of tagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "- Labels each word with its grammatical role\n",
    "- Examples: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, DET, PRON\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "- Identifies real-world entities such as:\n",
    "  - people\n",
    "  - locations\n",
    "  - organizations\n",
    "  - works of art\n",
    "\n",

    "- explore language patterns\n",
